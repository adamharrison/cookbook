# Garry's (Hyper-Opinionated) (Mostly Vegetarian) Cookbook(-ish) for Idiots (Like Himself)

Full of hard-won knowledge from the last ~13 years.

## Pasta

### Red Pesto (~10 Minutes)($$)

* Zest of one lemon
* Juice of one lemon
* Handful of pinenuts (2 tbsp)
* Handful of non-oiled sun dried tomatoes (10-20)
* Pepper
* Garlic
* Salt
* Cheese (pecarrino romano, or parmesan)
* Package of basil

Shove all that shit a food processor, and blitz. Add about 5 tbsp of oil.

When serving (and this is important), reserve some of the pasta water, and splash it in to a bowl before mixing in the pesto and serving.

### Alfredo (20 Minutes)($$)

* Cream
* Monzerella (1/2 Pound)
* Parmesan (I dunno, like a quarter cup?)
* Garlic 
* White Wine Vinegar (To taste, more than you think. Very important.)
* Pepper
* Salt
* Parsley (Garnish)

Add everything except parsley into a small pot, and cook on low until melted together.

### Puttanesca (1 Hour)($$)

* Olive Oil
* Crushed Tomatoes
* Onions
* Kalamata Olives
* Anchovies
* Capers
* Garlic
* Oregano

Caramelize onions and garlic with olive oil, then pour in crushed tomatoes, and add the rest. Cook for like an hour; less is probably fine.

### Pea Sauce (1 Hour)($)

* Split Peas, boil in just water, no salt.
* Parmesan/Peccarino Romano/Nutritional Yeast/Both
* Onions
* Yogurt
* Stock
* Butter
* Thyme (Garnish)

Make peas first. When done, optionally drain through a fine sieve. Caramelize onions. Add all ingredients togehter, and blitz. Serve over pasta.

## Generic Indian-Style Curry($)

* Toast any of the following spices in a pan (* is recommended): Mustard Seed* (should always be first, until they start dancing), Cumin*, Clove, Allspice, Coriander*, Cardammon. After a minute or two of toasting, grind to powder.
* Fry onions in ghee, some coconut milk, or vegetable oil. Add garlic, and ginger, until soft. Add spices, and salt.
* Optionally add tomatoes, and fry for a bit if you do.
* Add protein, of some kind. Eggplant, Chickpeas, Chicken, Beef, etc...
* Add liquid. Can be stock, coconut milk, cream, or just water.
* Taste; optionally add sugar.

Cook until cooked through. Serve with something pickled, or some form of sourness; pickled lime, tamarind, lime, lemon, yogurt. Serve over rice, genreally. Garnish with cilantro, or green onion.

## Mexican

### Chilli (~1 Hour)($)

Fry together lots of, until soft:

* Onions
* Garlic
* Celery

Once soft, add, and fry for a minute to reduce down

* Chipotles in a can/chipotle sauce in a can
* Cocoa powder (like a lot).
* Cumin
* Chilli Powder
* Oregano 
* Salt
* Pepper

Add:

* Can of crushed tomatoes
* Two cans of black beans
* Small amount of brown sugar/maple syrup/mollases

Finish with:

* Lots of lime juice
* Cilantro, Yogurt (garnish)

### Taco/Burrito Filling (10 Minutes)($)

Use a single container for this; prerably a glasslock. Doesn't need all ingredients; only needs the beans, really:

* Diced Bell Pepper
* Diced Onion
* Two Tins of black beans, drained, and rinsed (preferably patted dry, but honestly that sounds like a lot of owrk)
* Oregano
* Thyme
* Frozen Corn Kernels
* Red Wine Vinegar (1/4 Cup)
* Olive Oil (~1/2 Cup)
* Salt
* Pepper
* Sugar to taste
* Cilantro
* Lime Juice

Buy some salsa (or make some, but honestly that sounds like a lot of work; best brand price/variety/quality is Macha; but steer clear of the Taquira sauce. Don't fucking buy La Costena it gross).
Serve on pan-toasted corn tortillas (best brand is [La Tortilla Veloz](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0436/0722/8580/products/WhiteCornTortillalatortillaveloz_2.jpg?v=1603423077)).

### Mexican Rice (10 Minutes)(as a filling/stuffer for tacos/burritos)($)

* Raw basmati/jasmine rice. 
* Olive Oil
* Onion
* Paprika
* Salt
* Pepper
* Oregano
* Red Wine Vinegar
* Stock

Toast rice in a dry pot for like 3 mintues, on medium heat. Don't burn it. Add olive oil, and onion. Fry a bit, until onion's soft. Add spices, fry a bit more, then add stock and red wine vinegar. Not enough
to actually cook the rice as you would normally, it should be a little hard (not crunchy, but close). Use a a filler for burritos/tacos.

### Guacamole (10 Minutes)

Mask an avocado with a fork, or pastry crimper. Needs to be a ripe avocado. Don't do it with an unripe one, it sucks. Do the avocado first, get it creamy, then add other ingredients.

* Salt
* Lime Juice
* Garlic (Optional)
* Jalapeno (Optional)
* Onion (Optional)
* Pepper (Optional)
* Cilantro (Optional)

### Pickled Opnion (5 Minutes)

* Sliced Red Onion (not diced)
* Sugar

Put in fridge for at least an hour, better a day. Garnish shit with this.

## Miscellanea

### (The Best) Gin & Tonic

* Lime Juice
* Tanqueray (Rangpur Lime/Flora de Sevilla)
* Fever Tree Mediterrean/Elderflower Tonic

### Do's and Don't

* Buy tortillas, don't bother making them from masa. It's not worth it.
* Never use lime or lemon juice from a bottle.
* Sriracha is really good as a hot sauce.
* Both canned and dry beans are both good; use whatever you want more.
* Always boil hard pulses (except red lentils) *without* salt, usually just water until soft. Otherwise they'll be crunchy. Adding small amounts of baking soda can also make things much softer, but you can easily overdo it and get a weird taste.
* Never use parboiled "plastic bag" rice. Use either Jasmine or Basmati.
* Don't buy prepackaged guacamole.
* Squeeze the following fruit to tell if they're ripe (it matters): Mango, Avocado
* If you're getting tired of a dish, change the condiments (salsas, garnishes, sides) before throwing it out and moving on.
* Buy "Luminarc Working Glass" as your glassawre, both tall and short version. Get the specific plastic lids which fit over them, and you'll have an infinite amount of glass containers for sauces/half-limes, and other things in your fridge.
* Get an induction stove, if you can afford it. It's really worth it. It's better than gas, I'd say.
* Make all your pans cast iron pans. You don't need non-stick. I have 2 10" ones, and they're workhorses. You don't really need much else.
* Buy [this spatula](https://www.amazon.ca/Metal-Spatula-Set-Teppanyaki-Commercial/dp/B07H4PPKGW/ref=sr_1_14?crid=2XQU6NDUL7S71&keywords=thin%2Blarge%2Bspatula&qid=1652914863&sprefix=thin%2Blarge%2Bspatula%2Caps%2C74&sr=8-14&th=1). "Teppanyaki". Basically just get a really thin spatula that's metal. You'll thank me.
* Get rid of all your plastic shit, you don't need any of it.
* Get a nice big wooden cutting board. Toss all plastic cutting boards.
* Toss most of your knives. You need a 10" chef's knife, a small utility knife, and a bread knife. Get good ones. Spend like 50+$ each.
* Get the heaviest duty garlic press you can find. Don't get a thin aluminum one.
* Get the heaveist duty citrus juicer you can find. Don't get a thin aluminum one.
* Get 2 wooden spoons and 2 wooden spatulas.
